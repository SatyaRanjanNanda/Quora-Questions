# Quora Question Pairs Analysis

This project analyzes the Quora Question Pairs dataset to identify duplicate questions using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.

## 📘 Project Overview

Quora launched a competition to identify whether a pair of questions are semantically equivalent. This notebook contains the end-to-end pipeline including:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training (e.g., logistic regression, XGBoost, or deep learning models)
- Evaluation and conclusion

## 📂 Files

- `Quora_Questions.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook with all analysis and modeling steps.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset typically contains:
- `qid1`, `qid2`: Unique IDs for each question.
- `question1`, `question2`: The text of the two questions being compared.
- `is_duplicate`: Label indicating whether the two questions are duplicates.
